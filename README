Following steps are required for running the project:

1. Install pip with command "sudo apt install python-pip"
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt using command "pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt"
3. Create a superuser using command "python manage.py createsuperuser". Fill in the necessary details.
4. With this superuser, you can login in the system and access the Admin entity's functions.
5. Without login, only urls:
    /get-tasks-for-worker/{workerId}, /assets/all
    will work.

How to Run:

1. Run command "python manage.py runserver" from within the project directory (<directory-path>/housekeeping/)
2. Hit the following urls:
    127.0.0.1:8000/hkmanagement/add-asset                   Only works if login
    127.0.0.1:8000/hkmanagement/add-task                    Only works if login
    127.0.0.1:8000/hkmanagement/add-worker                  Only works if login
    127.0.0.1:8000/hkmanagement/assets/all
    127.0.0.1:8000/hkmanagement/allocate-task               Only works if login
    127.0.0.1:8000/hkmanagement/get-tasks-for-worker/{workerId}

    Anytime not being logged in while accessing Admin functions will redirect to login page.
    Login can be done by superuser credentials.
    For hitting admin panel, hit this url: 127.0.0.1:8000/admin
    You can log out from this panel to check logout out functionalities of the website.

That would be it.
